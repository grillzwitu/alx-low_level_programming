## Hello World
The files in this directory are scripts that serve as an introduction to C. These files and their functions are:
- __0-preprocessor__: Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable __$CFILE__, the output should be saved in the file __c__. 
- __1-compiler__: Compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable __$CFILE__. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension __.o__ instead of __.c__.
