## 0x03-debugging
This directory contains __C__ files that can be used to test the correctness of the code in another file previously created and the correct versions of some code that had errors(the project doc contains the complete codes). The files in this directory are;
- __holberton.h__: Header file containing all function prototypes.
- __0-main.c__: Checks if the function __positive_or_negative()__ is correct.
- __1-main.c__:  Commented out the part of the code that causes the output to go into an infinite loop.
- __2-largest_number.c__: Correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- __3-print_remaining_days.c__: Fix the __print_remaining_days()__ function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
