## 0x09-static_libraries
This directory is created as a demostration of creating static libraries in C. I have used some previously defined functions whose prototypes are contained in the header file to create a static library. The files contained in this directory include:
- holberton.h: A header file containing all function prototypes.
- libholberton.a: A static library created form my terminal.
- create_static_lib.sh: A script that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
